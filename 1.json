It was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.Bluetooth is managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG). A manufacturer must meet Bluetooth SIG standards to market it as a Bluetooth device."

The two assigned engineers from Ericsson and IBM to study the idea. The conclusion was that power consumption on cellphone technology at that time was too high to allow viable integration into a notebook and still achieve adequate battery life."

The first Bluetooth mobile phone was the Ericsson T36 but it was the revised T39 model which actually made it to store shelves in 2001. In parallel, IBM introduced the IBM ThinkPad A30 in October 2001 which was the first notebook with integrated Bluetooth."
